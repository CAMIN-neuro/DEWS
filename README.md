# DEWS
DEWS (DEep White matter hyperintensity Segmentation framework) \
: A fully automated pipeline for detecting small deep white matter hyperintensities in migraineurs \
* This site is still in preparation and detailed documentation is being prepared \

# Prerequisite
DEWS requries MATLAB in linux \
AFNI and FSL should be installed before running the program \
Please visit the web-sites below for AFNI and FSL
**AFNI:** https://afni.nimh.nih.gov/download \
**FSL:** https://fsl.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl/fslwiki/FslInstallation \
The required versions are MATLAB 2016b, AFNI after 1998, and FSL 5.0.8

# Versions
**version1-1:** Detecting WMHs using intensity-based threshold and region growing approach \
**version1-2:** Detecting WMHs using Gaussian mixture model (GMM) distribution clustering algorithm

# Test data
A total of 5 test data (T1, FLAIR, ground truth) are released
